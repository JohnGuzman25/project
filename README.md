- Practical skills❌ Black box - don't learn how it works  - [🔒 SSL Setup](docs/ssl-setup.md)

- Debugging ability

❌ Expensive - $20-50/month per app  - [🔧 Troubleshooting](docs/troubleshooting.md)

---

❌ Limited control - can't customize  - [⚙️ Advanced Configuration](docs/advanced.md)

## 🚨 Common Questions

❌ Vendor lock-in - hard to migrate

### "Do I need Linux experience?"

**No.** Chapter 2 teaches all the Linux commands you need. We assume you can use a command line (cd, ls) but explain everything else.## 💡 Example Projects



### "Will this work on Windows?"### MyWebClass Platform

**Yes.** You'll SSH to a Linux server from any OS (Windows, Mac, Linux). Windows users can use PowerShell or WSL.

✅ **Educational** - Understand every component  - **Portfolio Website** - Showcase your projects

### "Is $6/month really enough?"

**Yes.** A 1GB RAM VPS can run multiple small-to-medium applications. We show you how to monitor resources and when to upgrade.✅ **Cost-effective** - $6-12/month for unlimited apps  - **Blog Platform** - Share your thoughts



### "What if I get stuck?"✅ **Full control** - Deploy anything, any language  - **API Service** - Build REST APIs

**Every chapter has extensive troubleshooting sections.** Plus common errors are documented with solutions. GitHub Discussions for community help.

✅ **Transferable skills** - Used by real companies  - **Real-time Chat** - WebSocket applications

### "Can I use AWS instead of DigitalOcean?"

**Yes.** The course uses DigitalOcean for simplicity, but works on any Ubuntu 24.04 VPS (AWS, Linode, Vultr, etc.).✅ **Portfolio builder** - Impressive for employers- **E-commerce Site** - Online store



### "How long does this take?"

**20-30 hours total** spread over 2-3 weeks at a comfortable pace. You can go faster if you're experienced or slower if you're new.

---## 🤝 Contributing

### "Do I need to finish all chapters?"

**No.** Chapters 1-13 + 16-18 get you to a deployed site. Other chapters add security, databases, and automation. But we recommend all of them!



### "Can I deploy [my favorite framework]?"## 🛠️ Supported TechnologiesThis is an educational platform - students are encouraged to:

**Probably yes.** If it runs in Docker or on Linux, you can deploy it. The course covers Node.js and Python examples, but principles apply to any stack.
